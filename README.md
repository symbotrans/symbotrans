symbol translator (symbotrans)
==============================

symbotrans is a web application (HTML5, CSS, JavaScript) to convert
between symbols of multiple defined systems. A system can have multiple
variations.

Basically, systems and symbols and relation between these symbols have
to be defined in a translation table file (comma-seperated UTF-8 file).

This application was developed having translations between multiple
phonetic transcription systems used in the danish language in mind.
